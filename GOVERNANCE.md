## Governance

The HERMES project employs a lightweight governance model.

All decisions are made by the [HERMES Steering Group](#hermes-steering-group) 
together with the maintainer(s) of the repositories affected by the decision.

Decisions that adhere to a single [repository in the scope of the HERMES project](#hermes-project-repositories)
are made by *lazy consensus*: 

1. The maintainer of the repository makes a decision and notifies the HERMES steering group
(using `@softwarepub/hermes-steering-group` mention).
2. If no members of the steering group veto the decision within the decision period of one week (168 hours),
the decision becomes effective and can be acted upon. 
The maintainer and any member of the steering group can ask for a longer decision period, 
which must be granted. 
3. If one or more members of the steering group veto the decision, 
the discussion is discussed until consensus is reached.

Decisions that adhere to more than one [repository in the scope of the HERMES project](#hermes-project-repositories)
must be based on full consensus within the steering group. 


### HERMES project repositories

The following are the repositories that are governed by the steering group. 

- <https://github.com/softwarepub/hermes> (Maintainer: Stephan Druskat)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/ci-templates> (Maintainer: Oliver Bertuch)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/hermes-harvest-template> (Maintainer: tbc)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/hermes-plugin-git> (Maintainer: Sophie Kernchen)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/hermes-plugin-python> (Maintainer: Michael Meinel)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/showcase> (Maintainer: Oliver Bertuch)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/schema.software-metadata.pub> (Maintainer: Michael Meinel)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/github-action> (Maintainer: Oliver Bertuch)
- <https://github.com/softwarepub/concept-paper> (Maintainer: Stephan Druskat)

### HERMES Steering Group

The HERMES Steering Group has three members, 
each of who represents one of the three Helmholtz centers 
who were funded under the original Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration project (ZT-I-PF-3-006), i.e.,
German Aerospace Center (DLR), 
Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), 
Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ).

Currently the Steering Group consists of:

- Stephan Druskat (DLR), stephan.druskat@dlr.de
- David Pape (HZDR)
- Nitai Heeb (FZJ)

Whenever a member of the Steering Group wants to step down,
they are asked to nominate a successor.
If no successor is named,
the two remaining members seek a successor affiliated with the Helmholtz center of the leaving member.
New members of the Steering Group join if neither of the other two members disagrees with the decision to join.
