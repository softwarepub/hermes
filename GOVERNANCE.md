## Governance

The HERMES project employs a lightweight governance model.

All decisions are made by the [HERMES Steering Group](#hermes-steering-group) 
together with the maintainer(s) of the repositories affected by the decision.

Decisions that adhere to a single [repository in the scope of the HERMES project](#hermes-project-repositories)
are made by *lazy consensus*: 

1. The maintainer of the repository makes a decision.
2. If no members of the steering group veto the decision within the triage period defined for the repository,
the decision becomes effective and can be acted upon.
3. If one or more members of the steering group veto the decision, 
the discussion is discussed until consensus is reached.

Decisions that adhere to more than one [repository in the scope of the HERMES project](#hermes-project-repositories)
must be based on full consensus within the steering group.

### HERMES Steering Group

The HERMES Steering Group has three members, 
each of who represents one of the three Helmholtz centers 
who were funded under the original Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration project (ZT-I-PF-3-006), i.e.,
German Aerospace Center (DLR), Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ).

Currently the Steering Group consists of:

- Stephan Druskat (DLR), stephan.druskat@dlr.de
- David Pape (HZDR)
- Nitai Heeb (FZJ)

Whenever a member of the Steering Group wants to step down,
they are asked to nominate a successor.
If no successor is named,
the two remaining members seek a successor affiliated with the Helmholtz center of the leaving member.
New members of the Steering Group join if neither of the other two members disagree with the decision to join.
