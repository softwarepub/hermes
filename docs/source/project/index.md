**HERMES** is an acronym for "**HE**lmholtz **R**ich **ME**tadata **S**oftware publication".

To satisfy the principles of [FAIR research software](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068),
software sustainability and software citation, research software must be formally
published. Publication repositories make this possible and provide published software
versions with unique and persistent identifiers. However, software publication
is still a tedious, mostly manual process and impedes promoting software to first
class research citizenship.

To streamline software publication, this project **develops automated workflows**
to publish research software with rich metadata. Our tooling utilizes
continuous integration solutions to retrieve, collate, and process existing
metadata in source repositories, and publish them on publication repositories,
including checks against existing metadata requirements. To accompany the
tooling and enable researchers to easily reuse it, the project also provides
comprehensive documentation and templates for widely used CI solutions.

Many, if not most, publication repositories cannot be labeled "research
software ready" today (2022). In addition to the deposition workflows, this
project cooperates with the upstream [InvenioRDM](https://invenio-software.org/products/rdm/)
and [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) projects. We are working on the necessary bits to
**achieve full readiness** for these and put a nice badge on 'em.

While the project partners are members of the [Helmholtz Association](https://helmholtz.de),
it's by no means limited to it!

We have an open mindset and will release any outcomes as open material.
Software will be developed in the open and released with an open source license.
Any scholarly publications, documentation and training materials will be
provided open access.


## Get in touch!

We see our project as part of a global and inter-disciplinary effort to improve the state of the art in research software engineering, maintenance and scholarly communications around research software. We would therefore like to encourage discussion and collaboration around HERMES, and appreciate any feedback you may have on the HERMES project itself or any of its outputs.

### Getting in touch

✉ You can always write the HERMES team an email at [team@software-metadata.pub](mailto:team@software-metadata.pub).

If what you would like to talk about is easier to do in a video call, you are invited to join our weekly project meetings.
These take place regularly on *Wednesdays, at 10:00 CET/CEST* ([check to see what this is in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2022-09-14/10:00/w/HERMES%20project%20meeting)).

If you want to join us, please let us know via email first, so we can share details on how to join, etc.
We will also try to find a date and time that suits you, if you cannot make the regular time at all.

### Providing feedback

We collect feedback on the HERMES project in an [open project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hermes-hmc/project.software-metadata.pub).
You can [create an issue there](https://github.com/hermes-hmc/project.software-metadata.pub/issues/new/choose), or simply write us an email at [team@software-metadata.pub](mailto:team@software-metadata.pub?subject=HERMES%20feedback).
